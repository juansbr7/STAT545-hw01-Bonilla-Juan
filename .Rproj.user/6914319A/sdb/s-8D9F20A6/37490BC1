This is to prove my theory that I brought good things to the world.\nHere we have Colombia's Life Expectancy, gdpPercapita and Population digits since 1987 to 2004. As we can see in the graph below there was a hiccoup in the economy in 2002 follow by an significant recovery.\n```{r}\nmy_colombia<- a %>% \n  filter(country== \"Colombia\", year >= 1987) %>%\n  select(country, year, lifeExp, gdpPercap, pop)\nmy_colombia\n```\n```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}\nggplot(my_colombia, aes(x=year, y=gdpPercap))+ geom_path()+\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", color=\"green\", fill=\"steelblue\")\n```\n\n##  Now let's look at the growing life expectancy variable. Here are the increment numbers and **the function that I wrote** to see the results:\n```{r}\ninc<- function(x,y) {z<- x - y}\nmutate(my_colombia, inc_lifeExp= inc(lifeExp, lifeExp[+1]), inc_gdpPercap= inc(gdpPercap, gdpPercap[+1]))\n```\n\n## Now, let's see the population vs gdpPercap \n```{r}\nmy_colombia %>%\n  arrange(year) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(pop, gdpPercap)) +\n  geom_point(color= \"red\") +\n  geom_path(color= \"blue\")\n```\n\n## But enough about Colombia, let's see how other countries in the Americas have done since I came to earth:\n```{r}\na %>%\n  group_by(country) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(year, gdpPercap)) + geom_smooth()+\n  geom_point(aes(color= country, size= pop ))\n```\n\n#### So, we can conclude that most countries have seen some improvemnts in gdpPercapita and an increase in population. (Also, that I haven't learnt how to read the graphs and I specualte a lot, I'm working on that)\n\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nsuppressMessages(library(dplyr))\n#devtools::install_github(\"jennybc/gapminder\")\nlibrary(\"gapminder\")\ngtbl <- tbl_df(gapminder)\nggplot(gtbl, aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap, color = continent)) +\n  geom_point() + ggtitle(\"GDP per cap by continent\") \n```\n\n\n\n#####class\n\nThe change in population from 1962 to 1972.\nThe population, in billions.\nThe lagged gdpPercap\ni.e., the value that appears for 1962 would be the gdpPercap in 1957 (the previous entry).\nHint: use the lag function, then filter out the NAâ€™s created with the is.na function.\n\n```{r}\none<- gapminder %>% \n  group_by(country) %>% \n  filter(year > 1962 & year <= 1972) %>% \n  mutate(pop_growth = pop - pop[1]) \n\none %>% \n  mutate(pop_growth= pop/10^9)\n\ngapminder %>% \n  group_by(country) %>% \n  arrange(year) %>% \n  mutate(lag_gdpPercap- lag(gdpPercap)) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(lag.na_gdpPercap))\n\n```\n\n```{r}\n\n```\ntheme functions change the looks but not the nature of graphs. element_text(): titles, legends, breaks(add ticks in the axis), labels(in the axis)\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(nycflights13)\n```\nmutating joins:\nleft_join keeps the values in x and bring the common values in y, withouth bringing new rows.\ninner_join keeps only the common values in x and y.\nouter_join brings all the  valuesto x from y\n\nfiltering joins:\nsemi_join same as inner_join but it doesnt add columns\nanti_join \n\n```{r}\n(areas <- data.frame(country=c(\"Canada\", \"United States\", \"India\", \"Vatican City\"),\n                     area=c(998.5*10^6, 983.4*10^6, 328.7*10^6, 44)) %>% \n     as.tbl)\n\nleft_join(gapminder, areas)\ninner_join(gapminder, areas)\nanti_join(areas, gapminder)\nfull_join(gapminder,areas)\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
