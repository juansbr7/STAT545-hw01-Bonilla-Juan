## STATS 547 

**Homework 6:**
* part 1-----> https://github.com/juansbr7/STAT547Bonilla_Juan/blob/master/HW6.Rmd
* part 2-----> https://github.com/juansbr7/STAT547Bonilla_Juan/blob/master/HW6-2.md


Comments about the code in part 1 are commented inside the code chuncks. I could not generate a .md file so I'll include the html and Rmd version.

**Resources:**
