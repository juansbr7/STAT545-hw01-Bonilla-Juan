### The Github experience ###
This is the first time I experiemented with github. In order to understand better how it works in its core, I took the Git course in codeacademy and it was very useful and insightful. I had no issue installing Rstudio, Markdown, gapminder and all the other packages required for my laptop (mac) and I achieved to pull and push documents locally and online rather smoothly. I worked locally and on the browser in order to get used to the routine of pulling and pushing the documents and get them updated in both sides. 
Writing the markdown document was not very difficult, I created it in class and worked on it at home using markdown cheat sheets (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and the sample provided in class. I had a bit of trouble using images because sometimes the links break. .
