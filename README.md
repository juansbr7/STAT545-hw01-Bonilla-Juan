About Juan:

Education:* Completed a Master of Library and Information Studies at the University of British Columbia (graduating in May 2018).Graduated in 2013 with an Honours Bachelor of Arts with specialization in Ethics and a minor in Philosophy from Saint Paul University and University of Ottawa. Awarded with the Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program (ELAP) scholarship in 2010 and a bursary to study German language in Munich by Goethe Institut in 2013. The Person:

I am from Bogota,Colombia. I have been living in Canada for more than 8 years.

4 years in Ottawa.
1 year in Calgary.
3+ years in Vancouver.
When I am not working, I like to hike and meditate. I am ofently reflecting about happiness, goals in life, travels and dreams. I love drawing, daydreaming (which I think it is the richest source of new ideas) and programming. In my studies, I learned to do data analysis using Python and R and enjoy learning new libraries, functions and creating new projects.

In the future, I see myself working with a team of knowledgable people doing research and learning something new everyday.
