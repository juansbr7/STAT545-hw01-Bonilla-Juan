## STATS 547 


Update: It is fixed. https://juansbr7.shinyapps.io/first_app/
Shiny App https://juansbr7.shinyapps.io/PRapp/

The app works in my laptop and I deployed it to shinyapps.io successfully but the webpage doesn't work.

This is the code I get when I deployed the app to shinyapps.io:

```
" Preparing to deploy application...DONE 
Uploading bundle for application: 238748...DONE

Application successfully deployed to https://juansbr7.shinyapps.io/first_app/
Deployment completed: https://juansbr7.shinyapps.io/first_app/"
```
But when I go to see it at https://juansbr7.shinyapps.io/first_app/ it shows:
```
ERROR: An error has occurred. Check your logs or contact the app author for clarification.
```
I check the console and I see no errors.
Anyway, sorry for the nuisance, the code in the files does work.
